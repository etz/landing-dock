# landing-dock
Landing Dock is a one-pager that takes advantage of particles.js and web-music libraries.

## Install
1. Add a folder "assets/music" and place songs that include metadata about the track, but rename the tracks "1.mp3", "2.mp3"
2. Change the index page to change the amount of songs you have used...
3. Run music.php, then playlist.php
